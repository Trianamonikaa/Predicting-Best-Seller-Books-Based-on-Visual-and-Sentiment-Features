0,The Keto Diet  by Leanne Vogel  was my first keto book  The Keto Diet is a book that I use on a daily basis and it has grown with me and my keto journey  I am not sure what I was expecting from Simply Keto  maybe additional information or another book like The Keto Diet  Simply Keto is my  nd favorite keto book right now  but I am not sure I d buy it again  because The Keto Diet has more information and is easier to navigate   in my opinion  Clearly MANY people love this book and it s a good book    but   ,3,Positif,1
1,To many ingredients unless it s a holiday ,2,Negatif,0
2,Information is there  meal plans exceed the recommended max daily carb count  Asked for support via Facebook page  website   nothing  Keep it for a cookbook only  Don t believe Suzanne when she says she s here for help  No she isn t ,3,Negatif,0
3,Simple not too many recipes but does the trick,3,Negatif,0
4,Hope you like cream cheese,3,Positif,1
5,Like the recipes  But would have liked single portion measurements ,2,Negatif,0
6,Easy and informative  Great recipes  The food choices are good for every day and easy to make  Good information on amount of protien  fat and carbs,1,Positif,1
7,didn t finish reading  too complicate a food plan for me,3,Positif,1
8,Can t endorse this diet  Too much fat and food restrictions that seem to limit healthy eating  I bet it works  but don t feel comfortable with my mental health thinking I am not getting a balanced nutritional diet  Everyone has their own idea of what a healthy diet looks like ,3,Positif,1
9,Redundant  The author clearly told how she lost     pounds  however  in the frequently asked questions  she filled the book with the exact information previously penned  Many recipes are cooked in a microwave  so if you prefer not to use a microwave  you are out of luck  In the Kindle edition  the charts and table are so small that they are illegible,1,Positif,1
10,interesting,3,Positif,1
11,Not so different from Keto essentials  Even lots of recipes looks the same ,1,Negatif,0
12,Never used any of these recipes  I m Puerto Rican and I feel like the food just wasn t for me  I just researched all my food and add my own keto friendly ingredients  I felt it was a waste of my money,1,Negatif,0
13,Her books are definitely not what they used to be  I ve read them all more than once but I can t get invested in the characters the way I used to  This one could have used another chapter to let us know what Willa s up to  That being said all her books are like putting on your old comfy sweatshirt and I m sure I ll read the next one ,3,Negatif,0
14,Maybe I set my expectations too high  but this book was so anticlimactic I was upset at having to pay    bucks for it  The story was only ok with an abrupt and predictable ending  Characters ho hum  writing blah  It started out strong but petered out  as if even the author got bored with it ,3,Negatif,0
15,Not my favorite Tyler book  Spoiler alert  ends abruptly and the reader is left unsatisfied  There could have been so much more depth to the protagonist  Disjointed and unexplained family connections and the feeling that so much was missing from the story left me disappointed ,2,Negatif,0
16,I found this book to be very mundane for many pages  The plot was a little unbelievable and the main character learns what she needs to but not until almost the very end when I had stopped caring  It just didn t work for me  but I m sure other people liked it ,2,Negatif,0
17,I ve never written a review before but this is hands down the worst book I have ever read  Forget about the fact that he writing is average  there is no story here  No character development  no conflict or resolution  no plot period  The only positive I got out of wasting my time reading it is that other books that I thought were average now seem like masterpieces  Forget about the money that I spent I would like the   hours total it took me to get through the book back,1,Negatif,0
18,A portion of everyday life  Nothing much happens  Introduced to people  Living their lives  I read it fast  But I wasn t impressed by the story at all  Felt I ve read it in anne Tyler s books before ,3,Negatif,0
19, I  didn t find this novel as captivating as I had hoped  I didn t feel like I knew the character until half way through the book but I did enjoy the second half  I also found the ending to be abrupt as another review mentioned  I honestly hoped for more from this popular author but I m giving it a three because at least I was able to finish i,3,Negatif,0
20,Clock Dance was completely boring  maybe that was the point that the main character was living a boring life  It felt like it was written by a first time author who had trouble with the plot ,1,Negatif,0
21,Waste of time and money  Had high hopes and kept waiting for something  anything to grab my attention but to no avail,2,Negatif,0
22,This book is so lightweight  the storyline not even remotely realistic or believable  and just zero depth  Double Oy  Very disappointed  I m unclear how this book got good reviews  Just ridiculous ,1,Negatif,0
23,I enjoyed the book  but found the ending bizarre  I didn t see that coming   I am not sure what to think at this point ,2,Positif,1
24,B N is really working this book up for their August book club pick  unfortunately it was not for me  I was waiting for the  climax  until the very last page  It never happened   ,3,Negatif,0
25,Held my interest and liked the characters  Abrupt ending  Would have liked additional reaction from the family and the town,3,Positif,1
26,A story about a woman going through life and adjustng herself to the people around her  Does she find her hqppy self  ,3,Positif,1
27,This novel is not up to Ms  Tyler s usual standard  I found the characters flat  not well drawn out  and the plot not well developed  The ending was way too abrupt  pretty unbelievable while being predictable at the same time  The story seems to be an outline that was never fully brought to fruition  I have to say I found this book boring and uninspired ,2,Negatif,0
28,What has happened to Ann Tyler    Her books used to be wonderful but the last   have been awful  And this book    B O R I N G blah  I don t get all those   stars applauds ,1,Negatif,0
29,I normally like Anne Tyler s work  but this one  not so much  I tried and tried to finish this book  but by the halfway point I came to the conclusion that the characters were just flat to me  I couldn t determine any feelings or personality in them  The book was like watching tv with the sound turned off  I finally gave up  But I really did try to like i,2,Negatif,0
30,This was a free  NetGalley  ARC given for an honest review  Sadly  this is not a book I can recommend  I couldn t find anything endearing about the main character  I wanted to like her but couldn t  The plot was drawn out and the ending was flat and abrupt   ebook  kindle,1,Negatif,0
31,What a boring predictable book  It ended  I closed the book and said  wow     awful  What a waste of money  Uninteresting predictable characters  No one particularly sympathetic   not even the dog  What did it take Tyler    an hour to write this dribble     ,2,Negatif,0
32,Well I read this as part of a book club  I have mixed feelings  I am usually very easy to please and just like a good story but I did not see how this was a well written book at all  I found the continuous descriptions tiresome and not particularly insightful  I did like the story once Willa got to Baltimore and appreciated the fact that it wasn t told in layers of profanity  Gosh I just wasn t all that impressed,3,Negatif,0
33,I did not care for the timeline jumps or any of the characters   aside from Willa s dad  I did not find any of the characters likable  Only finished for book club  I am actually not looking forward to having to discuss this book at all ,1,Negatif,0
34,This is perhaps the most boring book I ve ever read  I kept waiting for something to happen  Waited until the very last page    nothing  Complete waste of time ,1,Negatif,0
35,This is my first Anne Tyler book and most likely my last  The story was weak and the main character just too pitiful ,1,Negatif,0
36,This book showed promise in the beginning  Secondary characters were not developed to the point where I could believe them  Not much of a story line  This author can write but needs material ,1,Negatif,0
37,I enjoyed this book  It did move a bit slowly at times  but Willa s search for a purpose after a lifetime of being governed by others  wishes rang true ,4,Positif,1
38,I am a big Anne Tyler fan and I enjoyed reading her latest  There are maybe a few inexplicable things about the choices the protagonist makes  as she becomes embroiled in the lives of strangers  However  the time jumps and the details about her background work well  and the characters and dialogue are well done  as always   This novel is reminiscent of  Breathing Lessons   if you are familiar with that  Better than her previous book  but not as brilliant as  The Accidental Tourist  or  Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant  ,4,Positif,1
39,Two of Anne Tyler s books are on my top ten best ever books  Ladder of Years and The Accidental Tourist  both of which I reread at least once a year  Clock Dance is definitely another Anne Tyler quiet yet sublime tour de force ,4,Positif,1
40,I don t have the nerve to slam Anne Tyler s book but I found it to be boring  Her characters were just too  now  to be interesting  The slightly down at heel neighborhood full of inner city characters who genuinely care about each other was too much of a stretch for my taste ,4,Positif,1
41,My first Anne Tyler novel upon a recommendation from a friend  This usually isn t the type of book I read  I found myself easily submerged into the life of Willa  I was pleasantly surprised about the plot twists and turns and the raw emotions described  Anne Tyler wrote a captivating novel about a fairly average person  I couldn t go a day without reading more ,4,Positif,1
42,Ann Tyler s characters are always a little off center  This short novel is sad  I felt bad for the main character and her husband and the others around her  but am glad I read it ,4,Positif,1
43,Absolutely loved this book  For me you can t go wrong with Anne Tyler  I would like a sequel though  ,4,Positif,1
44,Follows Willa from      to present Well written ,4,Positif,1
45,Well written and engaging as are all her novels    I liked the final resolution ,4,Positif,1
46,Easy read  I really enjoyed this book although the ending seemed abrupt  Overall I would recommend it  I wished Willa had been more empowered earlier on in life ,4,Positif,1
47,Easy  captivating story but I would have liked more closure to some situations like her sister  Her sons were another disappointment ,4,Positif,1
48,nice,4,Positif,1
49,Unbelieveably  this is my first read of an Anne Tyler novel  I found  Clock Dance  to be enjoyable once well into the text ,4,Positif,1
50,I felt like the main character  Willa  was sweet and sad  She wasn t someone who stood up for herself and she allowed things to happen instead of trying to take charge of any situation,4,Positif,1
51,As a devoted Tyler fan  it s difficult to say anything negative  but     the first half of the book was bland  It wasn t until Willa went to Baltimore that it took off into Tyler territory and the usual good stuff  The ending  well  a bit implausible  but people do such things  The child stole the show in this one,4,Positif,1
52,Anne Tyler is one of my favorite authors  Her novels never disappoint me  She always has a good blend of quirkiness in her characters and relatable qualities ,4,Positif,1
53,This isn t her best book  but I finished it in one sitting  Have a read for yourself   I wonder who she based it on,4,Positif,1
54,Warm and witty and poignant look at an American family and the way in which one woman comes to value her own person hood  Anne Tyler never lets me down ,4,Positif,1
55,I know Elizabeth and Sunny  I work at Theranos right now  All of this is lies  They are best company in world ,1,Negatif,0
56,The story could be crafted better  There are plenty of facts  people  events  but they are not distilled to elegant story  I read stories about Twitter  Facebook  Microsoft  Apple  Tesla  SpaceX  Google  Amazon and definitely several more high tech companie,2,Negatif,0
57,Too much repetition  too much unnecessary details  e g   the make  model  and color of each mentioned car   It would have been a good long magazine article,2,Negatif,0
58,Intriguing story of deception and hubris but it drags on  I lost interest about two thirds through  At the end of the day perhaps Elizabeth Holmes really just isn t that interesting ,3,Negatif,0
59,The story itself is captivating,3,Negatif,0
60,There s no doubt the book was well researched and sourced but for me read better in some of the excerpts I saw ,3,Negatif,0
61,Was not expecting the paper back to be a  Large Print  version  Not pleasing to read,3,Negatif,0
62,The story and writing are fascinating and well organized  The narration is severely lacking in emphasis or character ,3,Positif,1
63,It s ok they should just name it  she s a bitch ,3,Negatif,0
64,The      edition is a version published through a self publishing Amazon subsidiary called  CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform   It is missing several sections  example  Preface   Index   The formatting does not match earlier editions  example  statements in Bold and or Italics that the author used to emphasize in earlier editions are in the same font as the rest of the text in the      edition   We returned the book for a refund,1,Negatif,0
65,Not really sure why it took me so long to finally get through this one  Had it my bedside nightstand and would dip in now and then  Not as boring and dry as some have reported  actually clever and witty in spots but provides a solid foundation for symbolism in literature ,4,Negatif,0
66,How to Read Literature Like a Professor does not read like a textbook  It s a fun read that definitely taught me something  or multiple somethings    It also inspired me to read more of the classics  as Foster references many works again and again throughout the book,4,Negatif,0
67,The book i received was in decent condition  but it was the wrong edition  I should have received the revised edition  but I got the first edition instead  I m sure they re not too different  but they re different enough that my professor specifically asked us to get the revised edition  I ve attached a picture of the one I got in the mail  the wrong edition,4,Positif,1
68,Avoid this printing completely  It s a poorly produced  potentially bootleg  copy of the original  Sections missing  paginated by an insane person  no page numbers or index  Sent this piece of garbage back for a refund,1,Negatif,0
69,Boring,1,Negatif,0
70,Good book but boring and repetitive ,3,Negatif,0
71,ok,3,Positif,1
72,Foster is a relatable author and has witty humor if you understand his literary references but at times his point isn t exactly defined it s very difficult to get a set skill instead of just examples or anecdote of his,3,Positif,1
73,We were assigned this book for summer reading  I would recommend How to read a book by Mortimer J Adler   More constructive and less gratuitous ,1,Negatif,0
74,I  had to buy this book for my AP English class  It is helpful for people who need help finding the more hidden meanings in literature  but  for someone who reads a variety of literature  often  it wasn t of much use  The way the author writes keeps it interesting  though  It s not like an instruction manual  it s more like a conversation  That s something I liked when I did actually read the book  We don t know everything  so getting this book might help you see something you missed  You won t know until you read it ,3,Negatif,0
75,It was predictable and I was forced to read it for school  but informative   AP English    students  seriously read it  Like the almost every other lit book  it sucks to read but you really enjoy it when you re done ,3,Negatif,0
76,I  bought both the mass market paperback edition and hardcover one  The paper of hardcover is as cheap as the other one ,3,Positif,1
77,bought both the mass market paperback edition and hardcover one  The paper of hardcover is as cheap as the other one ,3,Positif,1
78,No issue ,3,Positif,1
79,the book was very informative and causes you to think twice about what you are reading  However I did think that the book was annoying at times  If you really want to read like a literature professor you should start here ,3,Positif,1
80,None,3,Negatif,0
81,Too many examples to show how well read he was,3,Negatif,0
82,Teaches you how to recognize paterns and themes  which is very valuable  However  it is very basic and only scratches the surface ,3,Negatif,0
83,I had to read this over the summer for my AP Literature class  and it wasn t so bad  I like how foster writes like if he was actually there explaining it to you ,3,Negatif,0
84,Chatty and readable but some examples are not quite clear ,3,Negatif,0
85,I chose this rating because overall it was well done presenting an interesting perspective but the topic is not one of my passions,3,Negatif,0
86,It s a college text book   what else can be said ,3,Positif,1
87,The concepts are pretty standard and seem like common knowledge  Just sparknote it instead to get the information without paying for it ,3,Negatif,0
88,oring   must read for school   ,2,Negatif,0
89,I can t exit out of this book to the homepage of my kindle  Is this a glitch or do I just suck at technology ,3,Negatif,0
90,It was a school assignment ,3,Positif,1
91,just vague info and not too educational  it is the author s opinion vs yours   guess whose opinion worths more  not yours  ,3,Positif,1
92,This damn book must be coming from Antarctica  I should have bought it retail  I would have it by now ,1,Negatif,0

94,Was forced to read for summer reading and points did not connect unfortunately  I ll have to use google at this point ,1,Negatif,0
95,Required reading for high school  Granddaughter not especially happy with it so just an  okay  read ,3,Negatif,0
96,Eh  Not very userful,3,Negatif,0
97,This is very very basic  I can see how it might help high school students  but if you know literature terms at all     say symbolism or metaphor then a quick read through is all one will need  I am glad I only paid I think       on my Kindle for it ,2,Negatif,0
98,I am middle school reading teacher and found this book difficult to read  I really wanted to read it and learn from it   but it was boring ,2,Negatif,0
99,Not my favorite  but I did enjoy it better than my other summer reading boo,2,Negatif,0
100,I  didn t enjoy the book and I had to buy it for school  which we never used  I didn t enjoy the book  and stopped reading  It was a pretty weird book  weird lessons,3,Negatif,0

102,I recieved a clean good book  but I personally did not enjoy it for it was for a school homework assignment but the book is in wonderful condition so i liked that,3,Negatif,0
103,My daughter is on track with the summer reading assignments  seems like it is helping for her year of lit reading ,3,Positif,1
104,The book is complete  a few pages with underlining  but it has definitely been used  and I would say quite a lot  Perhaps I am being harsh  but I would give it a  poor  rating  a  fair   maybe ,2,Negatif,0
105,Oh sweet six pound three ounce baby Jesus this book is painful and I would never recommend it to anyone who wasn t attempting to commit sepuku for dishonoring their clan ,1,Positif,1

108,Liked it because I like literature and I have taught literature   makes me think and that is a good thing ,4,Positif,1
109,I loved this book for many reasons  but mostly because it s so accessible ,5,Positif,1
110,This book will give new meaning to literature  I enjoyed the light hearted approach and the skillful manner in which the topics were covered  It will help students and older readers alike ,5,Positif,1
111,An excellent  introduction  for those who have a desire to understand literature on a deeper level  All great stories are more than the stories themselves  That is  the author is attempting to shine light on a deeper meaning  and Thomas  book is a supportive lantern to carry with you down that long literary road,5,Positif,1
112,You ll never read a book the same way,5,Positif,1
113,This is my favorite American novel ,5,Positif,1
114,One of my favorite novels  where nothing is what seems ,5,Positif,1
115,I really would be curious to see what kind of things Fitzgerald would have come up with if he lived in our time  It s a shame we lost him all too soon  because I think he has a unique voice and I would have liked to see more from him ,5,Positif,1
116,This was my first read of the novel  although I have seen one movie based on the story  I am glad I read this  if only to experience firsthand the author s lyrical prose that digs deep and conveys so much about the glittering world populated by these dazzling and superficial characters  This one definitely is a five star read ,5,Positif,1
117,He kept dropping subtle hints all along  like jewels  about the characters throughout the whole novel  making me linger on the importance of a word  a sentence  or a paragraph  I m so very glad I rediscovered him as an adult ,5,Positif,1
118,This is one of my favorite banned books    now  Just like everyone else  I read this book in high school ,5,Positif,1
119,An absolutely fascinating  tragic story of a  rotten society  that I would highly recommend to everyone  Truly outstanding work ,5,Positif,1
120,I enjoyed this book ,4,Positif,1
121,The book was maybe too subtle for me as a teen  I was moved by it as an adult  I recommend it  even if you ve read it before ,5,Positif,1
122,There is a reason why this classic novel bears to be read again and again  This beautifully worded masterpiece is so much more than a story of love lost  of disallusionment  It s the eternal struggle between love  money and power and how those factors determine the course of so many lives,5,Positif,1
123,There is passion  secrets  sadness  romance  loneliness  and violence in this book  it s short  but sweet and has a little bit of everything  I could read this book over and over ,5,Positif,1
124,I truly believe this is a book that everyone should read at least once in their life ,5,Positif,1
125,I highly recommend it as a Classic story ,4,Positif,1
126,This review is about this version of the book  not the story itself ,1,Negatif,0
127,I read this book  required reading  in high school and thought then it was a  nothing story  and re reading it forty years later  I haven t changed my mind  There was not one character in the book that I liked or even sympathized with  they were all so self absorbed but I guess that was the point,3,Negatif,0
128,Cool book whatever but the cover is really ugly  It s rediculously pixelated ,3,Negatif,0
129,The book I received is not the same as the picture shown  Different cover and poor quality  The story is good though  Don t let my one star review dissuade you from reading the book  I m just annoyed I didn t get the product I thought I was ordering ,1,Negatif,0
130,I am writing about the look of this book not the actual story  I bought this for my daughter who is reading it for school  The print is so small that it would give her a headache to read this book  You need a magnify glass to see the words ,1,Negatif,0
131,I read this book in high school and was not impressed with it,3,Negatif,0
132,I don t know why everything thinks this is a great read     to me it was a bunch of boring words that didn t make me want to read it  But I kept thinking that at some stage this book would get better  It never did for me  Not to say that others won t enjoy it  just I definitely didn t,2,Negatif,0
133,I  hated it  but I guess I m in the minority because it is a  classic   I found it very slow moving and dull  and only got through the first       pages or so  I ve been told it gets better further on in the story  but it is not worth my time to find out ,1,Negatif,0
134,One of my favorite novels  where nothing is what seems,5,Positif,1
135,I myself found this novel to be very interesting because of the differences we see now,5,Positif,1
136,Overall  a must read   And it s not very long  Could read in a weekend  ,5,Positif,1
137,This was my first read of the novel  although I have seen one movie based on the story  I am glad I read this  if only to experience firsthand the author s lyrical prose that digs deep and conveys so much about the glittering world populated by these dazzling and superficial characters  This one definitely is a five star read ,5,Positif,1
138,  I m so very glad I rediscovered him as an adult ,5,Positif,1
139,Trying to say how good this novel really is  is like trying to tell your sweetheart how much you love her  words are simply not enough  inadequate and flimsy intimations of the enormity of the task ,5,Positif,1
140,An absolutely fascinating  tragic story of a  rotten society  that I would highly recommend to everyone  Truly outstanding work ,5,Positif,1
141,I  cannot leave this book without some deserving criticism however  The character of Mayer Wolfsheim is a horribly negative Jewish stereotype  and I must say  I was repulsed when I read this character  because it was such a horribly negative portrayal of a Jew  the physical description seemed to concentrate on his large nose  his other attributes seemed to be that he was a gambler  somehow involved in the Black Sox scandal  of fixing the World Series ,4,Positif,1
142,Beautiful story  beautiful book     Gatsby believed in the green light the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us,5,Positif,1
143,I enjoyed this book,4,Positif,1
144,I loved this version of the movie  And  I m glad I read the book first  it really explained the movie   Having read some of the lead reviews  I agree that reading it at the age of    is totally different from someone reading it at the age of   ,5,Positif,1
145,The book was maybe too subtle for me as a teen  I was moved by it as an adult  I recommend it  even if you ve read it before ,5,Positif,1
146,This beautifully worded masterpiece is so much more than a story of love lost  of disallusionment  It s the eternal struggle between love  money and power and how those factors determine the course of so many lives ,5,Positif,1
147,I m not into reading items like this for fun  It wasn t exactly what I expected it to be  Was it a good story  I can t lie   it was  At times I had to pause to figure out what was going on because the style of writing makes it a bit harder to follow  Don t be lazy        don t rent the movie      read it  THEN      rent the movie lol lol,4,Positif,1
148,I personally love The Great Gatsby ,5,Positif,1
149,This was my first time reading  The Great Gatsby  and it certainly won t be my last  The book is beautifully written and the author writes in a powerfully evocative way  Fitzgerald sets up a scene with such skill that I truly felt I was part of the story ,5,Positif,1
150,Honestly  it was one of the few books I read because I had to that I actually enjoyed  ,5,Positif,1
151,I think the Great Gatsby is about the pursuit of something which may be inherently illusory  happiness,5,Positif,1
152,I never had a chance to read this when I was in High School  so I felt compelled to see all the accolades for this book  I enjoyed the book but I did not like any of the characters  They all seemed flawed and too sophisticated  To best describe this book is the pursuit of The American Dream,4,Positif,1
153,It s a cute story  but not my pick as a first grade teacher  throughout the book someone doesn t want to get up for school  You can t see the persons face as the  dad  tried everything to convince them to get up  It turns out it s the teacher who was so nervous about her first day she wouldn t get out of bed ,3,Positif,1
154,The joke was above my students heads  I think the book is better used for talking about being nervous rather than a first day of school read aloud  at least not in  st grade ,3,Positif,1
155,I  was pretty disappointed in this book,2,Negatif,0
156,I thought this would help my son with his first day blues    Instead it repeatedly states how the person hates their new school  and they re not going ,1,Negatif,0
157,Not a great story ,3,Negatif,0
158,Great book    horrible packaging  The spine was bent and broken when I got it and the book had actually torn through the package  It came in a standard bubble envelope  I ordered a similar book and it came in a small flat box and it was perfect,3,Positif,1
159,the book is very predictable  My students enjoy it but not my favorite  Very plain and nothing to write home abou,3,Positif,1
160,No  I thought it was about the students first day jitters  not a teacher,2,Negatif,0
161,This book was not what I was expecting at all  It s about a teacher and her first day jitters not a child  I purchased this for my husband who is a first grade teacher  I guess we were just disappointed when we got to the end ,1,Negatif,0
162,Its a good book and can be used at the first of the year for early school age children  Would suggest very early age children ,3,Positif,1

274,Good writing style but completely overhyped and boring story ,2,Negatif,0
275,The strong female protagonist of color and the analogy to modern day racist society is good  I expected more for all the hype it got  And the dual love interest story is so cliche it hurts ,3,Negatif,0

302,Unless you are just a really big fan that wants to support the brothers  you could stay away from this one and not miss much ,3,Positif,1
303,I  love the graphic novel  but the implementation on Kindle sucks  Unsure as to why there are two pages to each page  with grainy  pixelated artwork when you zoom in ,3,Negatif,0
304,This is a great adaptation marred by poor formatting  Book can only be displayed in the Kindle s landscape mode as a   page spread  which isn t my preferred way to read digital comics  As of now  this purchase isn t cross compatible with Comixology either  I still love this book  but readers would be better off with the physical copy ,3,Negatif,0

1054,I LOVE this book  It goes against this notion that most self help books push that we are all  unique  and  special ,5,Positif,1
1055, I wish everyone read this book  It is excellent ,5,Positif,1
1056,I hated reading this book  It took me about a year to read  ,5,Positif,1

1062,Well worth the read ,5,Positif,1
1063,Finally  I found the first half of the book to be much stronger than the second half  which is more philosophical  hence the   stars   ,4,Positif,1
1064,Don t give up on this too early  The last few chapters are easily its strongest  ,4,Positif,1
1065, would say  if you re looking at this book   give it a chance  Read it a couple of time to let the advise sink in ,4,Positif,1
1066,You won t be disappointed if you give this book a try,5,Positif,1
1067,his book really helped me learn to focus on the important stuff in live  Teaches great core values to have  I m doing better in college  enjoying life more  and have better relationships  ,5,Positif,1
1068,This is basically a book on Buddhist philosophy but written in a  modern  way meaning there is plenty of vulgarity  Duh  I did find it helpful and it reminded me to stop worrying so much  however  I began to tire of the F bombs after a while and found myself substituting the word in my head ,5,Positif,1
1069,Not worth the time to read it  I kept hoping it would get better but was sorely disappointed ,2,Negatif,0
1070,Sadly it was not scary which is what I was hoping for  I wish that he would go back to writing books like  IT   which to this day still scares me every time I read the book ,3,Negatif,0
1071, I wish there was a half star option  I would really prefer to give this     stars  I just can t justify   stars due to the regurgitated material and characters  Still  I recommend it ,3,Negatif,0
1072,Overall not disappointed that I purchased  but won t be one I would recommend or ever read again ,3,Negatif,0
1073,I have read all his books  so I feel like I know a little about his style  When I finally reached the big confrontation  it was a complete and total letdown,2,Negatif,0
1074,This was one of King s more disappointing novels ,2,Negatif,0
1075,So I ll say read this if you have nothing better in your read list right now  Otherwise  I was very much disappointed with all the hype ,2,Negatif,0
1076, I wont even read this a  nd time  and ive read every book hes written at least twice,3,Negatif,0
1077,However  since it is Mr  King  I must admit that I m disappointed in this book  ,3,Negatif,0
1078, In itself not a good story  first half was good  then it got silly  with a dissappointing fizz of an ending  ,2,Negatif,0
1079,How sad I was that I had recommended it  Who wrote the last     of this book  Certainly it could not have been the same Stephen King who wrote the first part    Not for me,3,Negatif,0
1080,Just finished the book,3,Negatif,0
1081,Not here  This is yet another effort where it seems King has phoned it in  more like a hastily written teleplay  None of the characters ring true or are developed to any degree  in fact  it was hard for me to tell one from another given their lack of dimension,1,Negatif,0
1082,I can read around them  as I already knew how he felt  In any case  I really like Donald Trump and don t much care if he does or not  The writing was very pedestrian ,1,Negatif,0
1083,King sucks now  He lost his mind from all the coke he used to do  Sad ,1,Negatif,0
1084,I am very tired of the political crap in everything you read  I don t care what your opinion is  its fiction ,1,Negatif,0
1085, There is no passion in the writing anymore  I hope this is just a ruff patch ,1,Negatif,0
1086, I am not going to read anymore of King s garbage that he is trying to pass off as horror fiction ,1,Negatif,0
1087,Time for him to retire ,1,Negatif,0
1088,Really wanted to buy this book but Stephen King gave us his political opinion in addition to his stories and I am not interested ,1,Negatif,0
1089,It was my first Stephen King book and I will never read another one ,1,Negatif,0
1090,It s not  I was embarrassed to be carrying it at the airport  King s written some great books  but repeated references to the bark worn off a stick from raping a boy with it  Why would King need to go so low  Don t spend your money on this kind of book ,2,Negatif,0
1091,way to long  and not very entertaining,2,Negatif,0
1092,Just hang it up steve  you re done  You can t write anymore  and I have a sneaking suspicion,1,Negatif,0
1093,Ridiculous  I don t care what Steven Kings political views are  I m reading for enjoyment and escapism  If I want that kind of info I will turn on the news ,2,Negatif,0
1094,OMG  This book was horrible  Stay away  Mid way through all the characters seem to change their personalities or something  One of the worst books I have ever read ,1,Negatif,0
1095,Now possibly I m just pages away from this information  I don t know  But I m so bummed ,1,Negatif,0
1096,I think it would have been better to stick with horror and less throwing his anti President Trump sentiment into this novel  ,1,Negatif,0
1097,Very disappointing ,3,Negatif,0
1098,This book is unnecessarily long  If you enjoy plot twists and exciting reading  you ll be disappointed by this book ,2,Negatif,0
1099, I usually enjoy Stephen King but this really disappointed me ,2,Negatif,0
1100,never have done that before  Shame on you Mr  King ,1,Negatif,0
1101,Not his best  Was half way through before his plot came together  Kinda sad,2,Negatif,0
1102, it is that bad  seriously  that bad ,1,Negatif,0
1103,After that it got too unrealistic and just plain dumb  I don t understand the five star reviews honestly,2,Negatif,0
1104,I wanted to like this book more  but I thought it was very easy to put down ,2,Negatif,0
1105,This book started out so promising and fast paced         then bam  it slows down  Way down  The final show down with the bad guy is about as anticlimactic as you can get,2,Negatif,0
1106,Not what I expected a tad disappointed,2,Negatif,0
1107,Don t waste your time with this one Horrible,1,Negatif,0
1108,Some parts in the middle were exciting  even gripping  but by the end it was a waste of time ,2,Negatif,0
1109,He has run out of good story lines           was his last good book  I hope he gets better soon,2,Negatif,0
1110,Had anyone else wrote this  would be three stars  From King  Huge disappointment ,1,Negatif,0
1111,It has a great start but it peters out towards a lack luster finish ,3,Negatif,0
1112,I m just SO disappointed  I ve always been a huge Stephen King fan  but this novel was just plain boring  It went on and on and on  for no good reason  His characters were shallow and predictable and the plot was a bit ridiculous  Unfortunately  King just did not hit the mark on this one  ,1,Negatif,0
1113,Don t bother with this book ,2,Negatif,0
1114,The only reason I finished it is because I paid for it,1,Negatif,0
1115,At my tipping point I thought  I don t care who did it,2,Negatif,0
1116,The ending was a disappointment,3,Negatif,0
1117,Sloppy  boring and the characters were instantly forgotten ,2,Negatif,0
1118,Easy to put down  Certainly not on par with The Stand or IT     King needs to steer clear of politics  He showcases his lack of knowledge in that area while clinging to a childish view  Reading this book was better than being bored,3,Negatif,0
1119,He needs to retire from writing as he has nothing left in the tank   ,1,Negatif,0
1120,Would not believe this is a stephen king book  It was okay but not his style  Very disappointed,3,Negatif,0
1121,This sadly didn t ,3,Negatif,0
1122,Very disappointing,3,Negatif,0
1123, I usually love Stephen King  but am really glad this was a borrow from the library  cause it was a disappointment to me ,3,Negatif,0
1124,Very disappointed  but I will still read his coming books,1,Negatif,0
1125,Sorry  avid fan here  and this is a dud  One of King s worst ,1,Negatif,0
1126,The first third was great then it became boring   repetitive ,2,Negatif,0
1127,I didn t like how long it took to get to the point  I felt this was a horror movie that is so corny is just hard to pay attention  I was left wanting more and expecting to get surprised  Never happened ,2,Negatif,0
1128,NOPE  Just vague parts that were inconclusive of origin  Sad day ,2,Negatif,0
1129,This is still true for much of his work  But not this book  As a great fan I wish he d go back to using a pseudonym ,1,Negatif,0
1130,My opinion is surely not the only one out there and not the only one that counts haha ,1,Negatif,0
1131,A good effort  unfortunately  like allot of his recent efforts SK simply doesn t deliver a great novel ,3,Negatif,0
1132,an informational book and a cook book  I initially bought the kindle version but loved it so much that I also bought the printed version  This is excellent for beginners as well as experiences ketogenic dieters ,5,Positif,1
1133,The foods are very satisfying and you re never hungry ,4,Positif,1
1134,I  like the book  but the ingredient lists are very daunting with many obscure hard to find things listed  She keeps talking about not wanting to  count calories or macros  due to stress  but it s stressful just thinking about the grocery list ,4,Positif,1
1135,This book is everything you need to get started or maintain a high fat  low carb lifestyle   I was eating a ketogenic diet for several months before I came across Leanne  Her book  YouTube channel and podcast have totally changed how I look at this lifestyle   Her book is packed with amazing information  guidance  easy to understand charts and delicious recipes   This book is a must have ,5,Positif,1

1142,This is a very thorough book for somebody wanting to take a look at the ketogenic diet,4,Positif,1
1143,This book is one of the few I have looked at that gets into the need to add vegtables with a higher level of nutrients supporting the human body  ,5,Positif,1

1153,The Keto Diet is big  polished  well laid out  and colorful  The tables and charts are visually appealing  For those just beginning a keto kitchen library  I would suggest starting with this book  It provides a thorough and appetizing education ,5,Positif,1
1154,Single people  with full time jobs and long commutes to where affordable housing is don t have time to sit down and make involved meal plans  It s too complicated and you get that sense after looking over the meal plans  Shame  the book otherwise is informative and well thought out  If you can afford a personal chef you should have them do this for you ,4,Positif,1

1164,I  highly recommend Leanne Vogel s new book to anyone who is interested in eating Keto   whether you re new or a seasoned veteran  this resource belongs in your kitchen ,5,Positif,1
1165,Seriously amazing  This book is incredibly detailed and very informative about ways to manage your own personal ketogenic diet,5,Positif,1
1166,I recommend this book at least once a week to people who are keto or are thinking about keto  The meal plan was super easy and practical to follow and my husband and kids enjoyed all the food too,5,Positif,1
1167,Excellent book   has all the information for starting on Keto and continuing on a healthy path using what works for you ,5,Positif,1
1168,Can not recommend this enough  I am tempted to buy more copies to give to my family as gifts  not because they do keto  but because the recipes are just that good ,5,Positif,1
1169,This book is amazing  Leanne writes in such a way that is easy to understand,5,Positif,1
1170,  I would definitely recommend it ,5,Positif,1
1171,But like a good meal     I appreciate that it will take time and I look forward to digesting this beautifully crafted book,5,Positif,1
1172,This has been easy even though I m in fasting season meaning no dairy or meat I still had a few recipes to follow in the book  I m glad I bought this ,5,Positif,1
1173,Really informative  I was an old school Atkins person way back when  and decided to try keto  same principle   ,5,Positif,1
1174,BUY THIS BOOK ,5,Positif,1
1175,I really enjoy this book  There s so much information  some I knew and a lot of new info  I ve tried several recipes already and enjoyed them all immensely  I love that there are several  paths  to choose from  a quiz  and info on choosing the correct path ,5,Positif,1
1176,This is an excellent book  It s packed with information and provides great variations to customize choices to your body type,5,Positif,1
1177,The ingredients are very expensive and not all of them are easy to find  I found it overwhelming for someone who is just beginning their Keto journey  Maybe when I ve been doing this for longer  and have a better feel for things I will come to appreciate this authors approach  Not sure I will come to appreciate all the recipes ,3,Positif,1
1178,This was way too complicated for beginning Keto  I almost gave up trying this diet because I was so overwhelmed with info and opinions I didn t need  I kept looking for some shortcut to just explain the basic diet and principles science behind it ,2,Negatif,0
1179,Very disappointed that this is a dairy free book  The description of the book doesn t mention that anywhere  so now I m returning it  One of the things this book claims is to take away restrictions of other Keto plans  but not eating dairy is the worst case restriction for me  They should make it very clear that these recipes are dairy free ,3,Negatif,0
1180,Also   it recommends taking a TON of supplements  so makes me feel like something in the diet is lacking if you have to take that much to get your proper nutrients  Huge red flag for me ,2,Negatif,0
1181,  I am learning new things but I will just have to look elsewhere for normal keto recipes that include dairy  I have not completed the book yet  so I will revise this review if I find the book value was worth the dairy omission ,3,Negatif,0
1182,And that is what this book lacks  for all its research  ideas  plans  and recommendations  there is never any awareness that if you weren t someone who made their own work schedule  and probably worked from home  and didn t have a lot of other responsibilities outside of oneself  that this program would be very difficult to follow,2,Negatif,0
1183,This is not a good book she spent the first     pages talking about her life  Then the rest of the book was very hard to follow  To much fluff not enough meat and bacon,1,Negatif,0
1184,I thought the recipes were too complicated and way too many ingredients the average person wouldn t have   I love Leanne s podcasts but sorry the cookbook didn t work for me,1,Negatif,0
1185, Do NOT recommend for someone who wants to actively follow and adhere to the ketogenic lifestyle ,2,Negatif,0
1186,So while the book was informative  and easy to read  it does NOT give me all the information I need  nor is it very helpful for daily eating ideas  Will need to look elsewhere for that since I do very much plan on eating a real meal for breakfast and I ADORE cheese ,3,Positif,1
1187,All of the information is clearly presented in an easy to read and easy to understand format ,2,Positif,1
1188,She is great  straightforward simple explanations with lots of insight  Check her out   she has lost     lbs ,1,Positif,1
1189,Other than mayonnaise  there are no dairy products included in any of the recipes  It should of been noted that it was a dairy free keto choice ,2,Positif,1
1190,Recipes are way to complicated and call for ingredients that have to be hunted down or bought on line  I will never make most of these recipes ,2,Positif,1
1191,Way too much information to comprehend  Recepies were too complicated for a busy family  I personally like something that is to the point and easy to read  This book left me confused ,2,Negatif,0
1192,The recipes are too time consuming and very involved with several ingredients needed  This book does not offer quick and easy recipes for busy working individuals  I expect to invest some time in making keto friendly meals but the amount of ingredients just for one meal is not realistic for the average person on some sort of a budget  Not worth the price ,1,Negatif,0
1193,great book with highly detailed info on keto diets  But so detailed  with so much info  appears overwhelmingly complicated to implement  With my busy life style  don t have the time to study all the details in this book   but great info if you can invest the time to work on it ,3,Positif,1
1194,Didn t use this book as much as I thought we would  Many of the recipes have contain ingredients that we can not find at our local grocery store,3,Negatif,0
1195,This book contains dairy free recipes and uses substitutes that may be difficult to find  If you approach keto in that way  this is a great resource  I feel the title and cover information is misleading and should denote the dairy free caveat ,2,Negatif,0
1196,This book is probably a wonderful tool for people who have already followed a Keto plan and are looking to up their game  However  I am a complete newbie to Keto and was looking for a straight forward  cut and dry  teach me quick book,2,Positif,1
1197,This is a wonderful book  there is a lot of very good explained information  I bought a digital version ,2,Positif,1
1198,I thought this cookbook was more like a lesson in eating Keto style  that I already knew about  Unfortunately there are very few recipes at the back of the book and was a waste of money as far as a recipe book I would every use  Wish I could send it back ,2,Negatif,0
1199,Visualization is good and she does explain things very well  However the recipes in my opinion aren t that appetizing  Also the ingredients needed to make the recipes aren t common items and I spent a lot of money buying the ingredients  Would like to see more budget friendly version,1,Negatif,0
1200,Really disappointed with this one  the author clearly has followers but I think they may be following her from trend to trend ,2,Negatif,0
1201,This book is very good if you have a lot of time to read  However I just want to get to the eating plan and get it going  I looked through this book once and haven t picked it up sense  Pretty much if you eat vegetables and meat you re on the keto diet  I don t think it s necessary to spend the money on this book just to figure out you need to eat meat and vegetables,2,Negatif,0
1202,This book provides many confusing diet variations it is hard to tell what one should do  Also  I got the impression that much of the contents of this book was based on the opinions of the author which sometimes did not seem to make sense to me,2,Negatif,0
1203,She just makes it so complicated  in my opinion  Every recipe has things I ve never heard of and don t know where to buy,2,Negatif,0
1204,I was really disappointed that it wasn t more obvious that the book was all dairy free,3,Negatif,0
1205,A lot of work went into this book  An amazing amount of work  I ll take what I can and then donate this book to our local library ,3,Positif,1
1206,This may be a very helpful book for hardcore keto dieters  but definitely not for me  Way too over the top ,2,Positif,1
1207,This book should be titled  The non dairy keto diet   Because of the  non dairy  the recipes were complicated  and subbed dairy with processed addatives  making a diet that should be easy   hard  I I work all day     i don t  have time for this complicated cooking and hours to spend and the grocery  I returned it ,1,Negatif,0
1208,The book will be very helpful  I m buying multiple copies but unfortunately the first one that arrived is a gift and it appears that it got wet and the pages are warped  It still functions  It came in plastic and hasn t rained here so it may have shipped like that  Hopefully they see this and do a quality contro,3,Positif,1
1209,Book is to confusing  Also  there is no dairy  I am a busy Mom and work full time  the recipes are not realistic for me  The book looks nice  colorful pages and recipes  It just seems to complicated ,2,Negatif,0
1210,Disappointed  Too technical and boring ,3,Negatif,0
1211,I really like the author and her ideas but for me these recipes are too time consuming and expensive ,3,Negatif,0
1212,The recipes are good  but this book is more about what Keto is and offering meal plans  If you want just recipes  there are better options ,3,Negatif,0
1213,I thought there were more recipes but it explained the diet also which is ok for a beginner but I have watched all the videos for this diet and just wanted recipes ,3,Negatif,0
1214,I am trying to read this but it is really information over load  I think I will have to look for a beginners guide to Keto  I think this book would be better for people who are already following a Keto eating plan who want to learn more about the diet ,2,Negatif,0
1215,Book has excellent information and the diet actually works  The problem I have with the book is it s MISSING PAGES  Pages       are not in the book  See attached photo  Book appeared new when delivered and there is no sign that the pages were torn out  They are just gone ,2,Negatif,0
1216,She explains the plan well  but she is so detailed and confusing  It seems very hard to do  Wish I hadn t spent money on this one ,3,Negatif,0
1217,This is not keto  This is low carb  Keto isn t     fat and     protein ,1,Negatif,0
1218,Recipies are too complicated ,3,Negatif,0
1219,Disappointed  I wanted a Cookbook  something with a bunch recipes  ideas for everyday meals  This isn t the product for that  Flipping through  I only saw     entrees that caught my interest  On the positive side  this book does a good job of explaining the Keto Diet ,2,Negatif,0
1220,if you re just starting a keto diet and don t want to get overwhelmed  this book is not for you  Try one of the five ingredient books instead  Otherwise  it has a ton of info for people who are serious about keto and want to know everything about it ,3,Negatif,0
1221,I read this book and really like her wide expanse of knowledge  I learned a lot about carb ups  etc  I ve made two recipes and have not liked either of them  I will try more and hopefully change my review in the future,3,Positif,1
1222,I like the book  but the ingredient lists are very daunting with many obscure hard to find things listed  She keeps talking about not wanting to  count calories or macros  due to stress  but it s stressful just thinking about the grocery list ,4,Positif,1
1223,This book is a must have ,5,Positif,1
1224,Thank you Leanne for taking the time to research  put into test and show us how to do it correctly  You have changed my life and now I m helping my mom to change hers,5,Positif,1
1225,Awesome  I was on the Ketogenic diet for almost a month before I got this ,5,Positif,1
1226,Every book should be formatted like this  Aside from the quality of the content  which is outstanding  additional aspects of the book keep getting my attention,5,Positif,1
1227,Overall  the book is great for knowledge  and the recipes are great for someone more familiar in a kitchen AND cooking for more than one person ,4,Positif,1
1228,if you re committed to making changes  then Keto by Leanne Vogel could be perfect for you ,5,Positif,1
1229,But it s so easy to pick right back up  I ve lost   lbs and can t be happier because I m truly enjoying food again  Just remember   slow and easy wins the race  Thank you Leanne for changing my life ,5,Positif,1
1230,Just incredible  I bought another popular book on keto but it pales in comparison,5,Positif,1
1231,he Summer Wives did not disappoint   it s my new favorite  I think what I enjoy most about the writing is the conversational tone  I almost feel like I m there and a part of it  This book had everything I enjoy in a book   a little mystery  a little romance  great storytelling  and an ending that kept me on the edge of my seat  No spoilers here  but I had suspected something about Miranda and was so happy I was right ,5,Positif,1
1232,This is a beautifully written story ,5,Positif,1
1233,What happens on the island stays on the island  The privileged ones come in summer and dine at the club  The full time residents work hard and worship at the Catholic church  But  everyone protects all secrets  Worth the read,4,Negatif,0
1234, Beautifully written  I loved the way the chapters were divided into the years of change and events  Great story ,5,Positif,1
1235,Another great read by one of my favorite authors ,4,Positif,1
1236,I never thought I d read a book as beautifully written as Angle of Repose  but the characters in The Summer Wives are just as real  and their very human hearts send them careening down life s steepest paths  making me want to cover my eyes and peek through my fingers at the same time  This is one of those works of fiction that is truer than real life  Highly recommended ,5,Positif,1
1237,I could not put this book down  I woke up in the middle of the night to keep reading it  I carried my kindle around just to snatch a few pages here and there  Such an awesome read  It captured my imagination and my heart ,5,Positif,1
1238,I  adored this novel  While many reviewers made references to it being an historical novel  the timeline seemed too recent ,5,Positif,1
1239,I liked the characters  at once new and yet somehow familiar to the characters of Williams  other books  The plot was interesting  but ending and  twists  were unoriginal  unfortunately,3,Positif,1
1240,This reminded me so very  very much of Daphne du Maurier s voice and style  It kept me enthralled from page one,5,Positif,1

1243,seemed like a nice read  but at a certain point it just became boring and nothing really really happened    ,3,Negatif,0
1244,perfect summer read,5,Positif,1
1245,I  enjoyed this story and getting to know the characters  At times it was a little difficult to follow the connections and relationships because of the jumping of the time periods  A great summer read if you like the opulence of island living in days gone by ,4,Positif,1
1246,This book was so good  I loved the story and the scenes the author set ,5,Positif,1

1256,Absolutely no surprises here and very poor character development  I had to force myself to finish it,2,Negatif,0
1257,This was an alright book  engaging enough that I kept reading it  and finished it in about two days  I wouldn t actively go looking for anything else by this author  unlike some other books I ve won ,3,Positif,1
1258,This book would be fine as a low key beach type of read  Based solely on Summer Wives  I don t feel inspired to pick up any other books by this author ,3,Negatif,0
1259,I thought this was a good book  but not great  It kept my attention but I felt the format of going back and forth between multiple stories didn t quite work,3,Positif,1
1260,I just could not get into this book  The characters weren t very likable so it was hard to care about what happened to them  I was very excited to read it because it s the kind of book I usually like but not this one  It was well written but just didn t grab me,2,Negatif,0
1261,A very depressing book about people I wouldn t want to know  Only the male protagonist has any honor or spine  Very disappointing ,2,Positif,1
1262,I am an avid reader and stayed on the library wait list for weeks to read this one  I tried to enjoy this book but with about     remaining  I returned the book and didn t finish it  I was looking forward to this one  but it became boring ,3,Negatif,0
1263,This novel was good but not Beatriz Williams  best  I felt like I knew what was going to happen halfway through the book  It was a good beach read as it kept my attention ,3,Positif,1
1264,The book is well written  The storyline is high society and island living  It s not typically the type of books I enjoy  I thought it dragged a bit until the end when a lot of the action began  I would recommend this book if you enjoy historical fiction and society living ,3,Positif,1
1265,This was a fun  beach read  type of book  Enjoyed the twists and turns of the story and thought the main characters were well described  Good writing  Easy read  I would recommend this book as an alternative to some of the more intense novels out there,5,Positif,1
1266,I love Lauren Weisberger and have been looking forward to this book for some time  It didn t disappoint  The story was only a little predictable in one part but otherwise was very entertaining and a quick read  Great summer read ,5,Positif,1
1267,This book is a fun beach read  It made me happy that I don t live in Connecticut in an enclave of silly women but then I think it was supposed to make me feel that way ,4,Positif,1
1268,Recommended ,4,Positif,1
1269,I  thoroughly enjoyed this book  Predictable   perhaps   but written in a loving kind way  Loved the characters and frankly enjoyed this warm caring book,4,Positif,1
1270,Such a great beach read  I couldn t put it down  but I hope there is a sequel to this particular book  So much happens and I feel like there can totally be another story to follow up on the characters ,5,Positif,1
1271,was expecting a fast light read but it was much better than I expected  I felt like I knew the   friends and each of their quirky personalities  They all had different perspectives on men  marriage  kids  the suburbs  and life  Very well written and the ending made me feel satisfied and content  Great book ,5,Positif,1
1272,Loved loved loved it  Wonderful story with great characters  Lots of laughs and unpredictable outcomes  Revenge is sweet  A must read,5,Positif,1

1300,Eh  One of those books that you ve paid for and now feel compelled to read   stereotypical characters and trite dialogue coupled with celebrity name references   disappointing read,2,Negatif,0
1301,I I liked the interaction between the three main characters  They each came at the situation from a different perspective  which was fun and interesting  It was a little predictable  though  but a satisfying read ,4,Positif,1
1302,Its a good read and I was interested the moment I started reading  I am    so the modern view was really fun because I could enjoy the little things like movie references and slang  I also love hardcover books and medium sized print so this book was perfect ,5,Positif,1

1312,This will sound harsh  There are so many good books waiting to be read  I am so sorry I wasted time and money on this one  Cliche  trite  boring and insulting to women everywhere  ,1,Negatif,0
1313,On a whim I read this   loved The Devil Wears Prada and this author  Sadly this one misses the mark on so many levels  None of the characters were realistic and why were they friends  Just a boring romp   and pretty implausible ,2,Negatif,0
1314,Fairly average and predictable,1,Negatif,0
1315,On one hand  I don t want to be too harsh on this book  It s not meant to be great literature  just entertaining  But entertaining  light fiction can be much smarter than this,2,Negatif,0

1320,The Devil Wears Prada was so good  and this was so boring ,1,Negatif,0
1321,This book starts with a bang  but rather than the plot thickening  it just thins and thins into a prolonged happy ending  I am about     done  but can t really force myself to finish reading it  because all the conflict and intrigue ended a long time ago  Most of it was never even there to begin with  just some honest misunderstandings    ,2,Negatif,0
1322,I think it is a book you won t get so lost in that you get sunburned  Yeah  I could stop and reapply sunscreen at anytime during this book  Not too engrossing  If by  beach read   you mean a book you don t mind others seeing you read  I m not so sure  Also  none of the characters really accomplished anything on their own ,2,Negatif,0
1323,Didn t love it  didn t hate it  The main characters were sometimes so similar I had a hard time keeping them straight,3,Positif,1
1324,This is the book equivalent of the movie  The Room   It s got to be some sort of weird joke that the author is playing on people  I can t believe anyone would publish this garbage ,1,Negatif,0
1325,I  really liked Devil Wears Prada so gave this a try  Lots and lots of brand names and pop culture references  Dialogue kind of corny and didn t ring true  But OK if you want a really light read ,1,Negatif,0
1326,I though I d learn how to make lululemonade  but it s not really that sort of book  My mistake  but I m still disappointed ,3,Negatif,0
1327,it was ok  Not my fav but ok to pass time  Read in a day  Very light  Maybe you ll enjoy it ,3,Positif,1
1328,Entertaining read  but seemed to lack story development for all the characters  The characters were not as well rounded as people so as story went along did not live up to the beginning part of the book ,3,Negatif,0
1329,This was a fun  beach read  type of book  Enjoyed the twists and turns of the story and thought the main characters were well described  Good writing  Easy read  I would recommend this book as an alternative to some of the more intense novels out there ,3,Positif,1
1330,An interesting and developed novel  Not exactly what I was expecting  but interesting ,4,Positif,1

1333,This was June s book of the month recommendation,5,Positif,1
1334,Great debut novel  The first few pages were a bit slow but after them  I couldn t put this book down  I loved the main characters  Erin and Mark  and the way the plot developed page by page ,4,Positif,1
1335,Great book  Kept my attention and I finished it in just   days  very unlike me   Didn t realize this was written by an actress on Downton Abbey and that it s actually her first book  as far as I could tell when I went to look for other books by this author   Really enjoyed it  The plot just kept  thickening  and it turned into quite the page turner ,5,Positif,1
1336,Very good book  Especially since it s her first novel  I don t know how I feel about the ending which is why I took off one star  And if you think about it the mystery was kind of easy to predict  It was one of my theories as the character brought up the theory herself a coupe of times  But it s definitely a page turner and a good read especially if you like mysteries ,4,Positif,1
1337,Great beginning  middle  not so much the ending   I was really disappointed in the ending  The rest of the book was excellent though  I really had no idea Mark was involved in anything sinister at all ,5,Positif,1
1338,Love love love this book  A story narrated by the wife who was having serious thoughts and her husband had the same  Amazing,5,Positif,1
1339,This book was really good all the way through but I was a little disappointed in the ending  But I would still highly recommend it keeps your interest and is very well written  You have to get half way through before you find out what the  something  is ,5,Positif,1
1340,This novel has been a  refreshing   ha  alternative to most mysteries that I have read  I sometimes think of myself as an amateur sleuth and can figure out where the plot turns  but I was actually  holding my breathe  until this storyline ended ,5,Positif,1
1341,The characters were really well developed  A happily married couple  But then Mark loses his job  they take an unsettling trip to Bora Bora  and then nothing seems as it was  Good thriller with an unexpected twist that turns into a happily ever after ,5,Positif,1
1342,Read this book    It s one of the most gripping novels I ve read  I love the way the main character reasons her way through some pretty drastic predicaments  I m hoping there will be a movie adaptation made,5,Positif,1
1343,Just read it during a week vacation in FL and loved it  Great beach or trip read  Easy quick read  but very engaging story,5,Positif,1

1348,Slow start but was finally sucked in about     of the way in and couldn t put it down till I finished it  Felt the ending was a bit lacking    without giving it away  I wish the motives were clearer  I could totally see this becoming a movie  though ,4,Positif,1
1349,This book is such a fun summer read  The storyline kept me pulled in from the very first sentence and I never wanted to put it down  Thought provoking  suspenseful and surprising  I read it with friends for a book club and we all loved it ,5,Positif,1

1351,I chose this rating because from the very first  this book captured and held my attention  I started this book while traveling so I was listening not reading but when I got home I switched to reading it  The trip was    hours long and I was mesmerized and just HAD to finish but couldn t wait to listen ,5,Positif,1
1352,Completely lured in and engaged by the story line  Would have given   stars until the last few chapters  Very unfulfilling ending  Way too many loose ends  Would have loved a  nd half  from another character s perspective ,4,Positif,1
1353,What started out as a rather slow beginning  quickly turns into a page turner  I so wanted to be mad at the heroine but found her driven by her curiosity just as i was strung along in the plot  I so did not see the end coming  but her logic was so spot on  Definitely suggest this book ,5,Positif,1
1354,There were a lot of twist and turns in this story which were a surprise  But I wonder if Marks character was bad for the beginning ,5,Positif,1
1355,This book kept me on the edge of my seat  I loved the narrator and the twists and turns in the plotline kept me thinking  You will love this book ,5,Positif,1

1357,It was a slow start but picked up on the second half  The characters were well developed and I found them easy to believe ,4,Positif,1
1358,Fast moving page turner  Only one thing I didn t like and you or may or not  There are too many   f  words,5,Positif,1
1359,A wonderful debut  Plausible and daring  One of the best openers I ve ever read  Definitely worth taking to the beach this simmer,4,Positif,1

1367,Great  suspenseful read  Yes  the narrator will drive you a little crazy and yes  you know the buggest plot twist from the very beginning  But even with that said  I really enjoyed this book  It had enough potential scenarios to not see every little thing coming  Definitely a great beach read ,4,Positif,1

1380,I actually loved reading this book    once I got past the honeymoon  I found it hard to put down  Even though she does reveal in the first chapter whose grave she is digging  I still had hope that it was somehow a big mix up  I enjoyed the storyline  it s a fun summer read   I really started to like Erin and Mark  despite their character flaws  Also  I read that this is possibly being made into a movie  which I could envision the whole time I was reading  Loved the British ness of this also ,5,Positif,1
1381,Page turner  you think you know where the story is going but swerves and heads in different directions  Her characters are lively  fully brought to life  and keep you invested to the final page ,5,Positif,1

1393,Good summer read,4,Positif,1

1412,Love love loved this book  Definitely kept me questioning things until the very end  Highly recommend ,5,Positif,1
1413,Reese  honey  you steered us wrong on this one ,2,Negatif,0
1414,The plot makes no sense  I have no idea why anybody does anything  and the ending is a big  So what  ,1,Negatif,0
1415,Do yourself a favor and skip this one  Poorly written  filled with ridiculous plot twists  loose ends  and hollow and annoying characters  Going straight into the donation bin ,1,Negatif,0
1416,Meh  This book was a disappointing pick from Reese  The characters were unlikeable and unbelievable  and the plot was poorly developed  I felt like I was reading something written by one of my middle school students   ,2,Negatif,0
1417,I thought the ending was very anticlimactic compared to the rest of the story  I didn t see much of a motive to what Mark did and the way the protagonist reacting after everything was done and over seemed almost too calm and unrealistic  I don t always need to know what goes on inside each characters head or their way of thinking  but I still just didn t think the ending fit the story ,3,Negatif,0
1418,If you don t like anyone in it  can you like the book  I found characters an amalgam of selfish  short sighted  illegal and somewhat unbelievable  so really didn t care what happened and sped read to end ,2,Negatif,0
1419,This started out promising but in the end it missed the mark  The protagonist is annoyingly naive and foolish  but not in a likable way  the plot twists are predictable and there are so many threads to the story that lead nowhere  The ending is a let down too ,3,Negatif,0
1420,This book disappointed almost immediately  Well trod territory with stock characters  a predictable plot  quite similar to the superior SINCE WE FELL by the writer Dennis Lehane   a protagonist who never surprised us  and a narrative that often stifled the suspense  Sorry  not my cup of tea ,2,Negatif,0
1421,I  was looking forward to this book  one I thought a number of my family members might enjoy as a birthday or Christmas gift  What I found was a novel that I would label predictable  improbable  and immature  Sorry to say  I really cannot recommend this book to anyone who wants a well written novel ,3,Negatif,0
1422,I  finalllly forced myself to finish this book  I hated the main character  All I kept thinking was   What a stupid bitch   I ended up feeling sorry for her husband  I am fairly certain that I will not buy another book recommended by Reese Witherspoon,2,Negatif,0
1423,I was disappointed  Not very realistic  In some areas the new author shows strength in narration and character dialogue  however  it is very sporadic  At times the book is actually  dragging  and did not hold my attention  At times I felt I was only keeping at it to get  through it   I would only recommend if this was a  free read  and you have time you need to kill and when the content isn t that important ,2,Negatif,0
1424,I chose to read this book after I saw it s part of Reese Witherspoon s book club  This book disappointed me so much  I have read many great thrilling novels and it doesn t even come any closer ,2,Negatif,0
1425,This book grabbed me from the first page  I read it in one setting  I read lots of mysteries and this one was a new and different plot  Hope she writes more ,3,Negatif,0
1426,I  bought this assuming it would be great because it s in Reese Witherspoon s book club  WRONG  It s AWFUL  Boring  No thanks  Waste of money ,1,Negatif,0
1427,Looks like a first book of a potentially good author  Needs a little fleshing out  entertaining beach read  Try it ,3,Negatif,0
1428,Ponderous beginning  exciting middle and unreadable last third  I just couldn t finish  I read the reviews and had high expectations  but decided it wasn t worth my time to finish ,2,Negatif,0
1429,Clever first person narrative but predictable  plot twist  halfway through  Almost a self generating spoiler alert ,2,Negatif,0
1430,not really my kind of story,3,Negatif,0
1431,Slow read  Didn t become a page turner until the final few pages  Wouldn t recommend to others ,2,Negatif,0
1432,It was ok ,3,Positif,1
1433,Too long and drawn out ,3,Negatif,0
1434,I  ve read a lot of Reese s picks and have been happy with all of them  This one  not so much  Found it boring  then entertaining  then back to boring with a very anti climactic ending  Maybe skip this one ,3,Negatif,0
1435,Too long and drawn out ,3,Negatif,0
1436, was fooled  but not by any great twist  I was duped into thinking this book would  in some way  surprise or intrigue me  It did neither  Amateur writing at best  Don t waste your money ,1,Negatif,0
1437,It was very good at the start and slowly went down hill from there  The ending was ridiculous ,3,Negatif,0
1438,Never cared for the protagonist  who s impulsive and dim  I felt as if I was suppose to care and didn t  Best part of the book was learning what flotsam and jetsam were ,1,Negatif,0
1439,The main character was unlikeable ,2,Negatif,0
1440,Definitely wanted to find out what happened     just took a long time to get there  I skimmed a few pages to move it faster so it was good ,3,Negatif,0
1441,There were glaring cut flowers but make the story impossible to believe  But it very well written,3,Negatif,0
1442,Meh  I guess it was ok  Nothing to write home about really  But something to pass the time I suppose ,3,Negatif,0
1443,Knew where the story was going the first chapter into the book  Only read it because i felt bad paying that much and discarding it ,1,Negatif,0
1444,I won t be recommending this read  but I may try something else by this author if she can improve on plot and character development ,2,Negatif,0
1445,I thought it was going to be more suspenseful  From the beginning I knew what the outcome was going to be ,2,Negatif,0
1446,Predictable and slow,3,Negatif,0
1447,The beginning of this book should have been my warning sign  a writer who starts off a mystery this way is going to have trouble sustaining the suspense  Predictable plot twists galore  This book had potential but didn t quite make it ,3,Negatif,0
1448,It was ok  ,3,Positif,1
1449,Not hard to figure out ,3,Positif,1
1450,Disappointing because they were points that could ve been easily edited ,3,Positif,1
1451,The characters are completely unlikeable that by the middle of the book you just stop caring what happens to them  I m really glad I don t know these people   well except maybe the cockney crime boss  he at least has some redeeming character features ,2,Negatif,0
1452,I really wanted to like this book because I love thrillers  but it was relentlessly stupid  The plot is cliche  the main character is unlikeable and ridiculously naive  and the ending is completely predictable  I think all the hype is due to the fact that the author is a celebrity  it s certainly not because of the content,2,Negatif,0
1453,Slow start  then I was hooked and it fell apart again  There are parts and people in the story that made no sense why they are there  The ending left me scratching my head  Sadly  I wouldn t bother purchasing  Is worth the read if you borrow from someone ,2,Negatif,0
1454,Not bad for a first novel  Plenty of suspense and a decent ending  but I guessed the ending way in advance  it was obvious to me   and I felt the first chapter was awful and completely unnecessary  I would add that a really good writer would not have to resort to such a liberal use of the F word  ,3,Positif,1
1455,A good summer or beach thriller  an easy read  There were too many loose ends and unbelievable plot events  An okay debut novel ,3,Positif,1
1456,I enjoyed this book but it didn t captivate me like other books in it s genre ,3,Positif,1
1457,I enjoyed this novel  which kept me guessing until very close to the end  The author is also an actress who appeared on Downtown Abby  an interesting side note  She did a good job with this story  which delivers a romantic suspense thriller that takes the reader into different world s alongside the female main character  I enjoyed this story  Well done,3,Positif,1
1458,It was fine  It s a book  In retrospect  I m pretty surprised at all the reviews that said  great plot twists   cause yeah  there are plot twists  but they re pretty standard and easy to see coming  You want real plot twists  Try Marisha Pessl  now she knows how to write a plot twist ,3,Positif,1
1459,Overall  I can t say I regret reading it  but it was disappointing  and I don t think I would recomend this to a friend ,2,Negatif,0
1460,I do like a good psychological thriller  but this one did not do much for me  The main characters actions were totally unbelievable and the plot was unstable ,3,Negatif,0
1461,i ll admit to being disappointed but recommend it all the same ,3,Negatif,0
1462,Having said that I would still recommend this book  and I look forward to reading future books from this author ,3,Positif,1
1463,This is a book with a strong theme on bad decisions  ,3,Negatif,0
1464,I  was mildly disappointed at the ending  because it was something that I least expected ,3,Negatif,0
1465,I felt that the subplot  about Erin making a documentary about criminals was interesting and I liked how it was woven into the story  but all in all  this book was not one of my favorites ,3,Negatif,0
1466,The beginning and ending are wonderful  So intense  It makes you wonder just how well you really know someone ,3,Negatif,0
1467,recommend this one ,3,Positif,1
1468,What an awful book  Completely implausible  main character dumber than a post  tedious details about google searching and YouTube videos  Yuck  A friend recommended this  and I had no idea about the Reese Witherspoon connection ,1,Positif,1
1469,wow  I read so many amazing reviews about this   and I m not a super tough sell when it comes to an enjoyable read   but this was painful,1,Positif,1
1470,So disappointed in this  ,1,Positif,1
1471,This is an awful book  The character is infuriating  annoying  self absorbed and just an idiot  There s lots of colorful and descriptive language too much  Her mindless train of thoughts or idiot reasoning when trying to be a criminal is just painful  By the end of the book  I just wanted the main character to be put out of her misery  for all of us,1,Negatif,0
1472,Literally THE WORST book I have ever read  The plot is not only bad and typical but annoying  On top of that  the main female character  the one telling the story  is incredibly  beyond imagination  stupid  But she thinks she is so smart and ahead of the game he entire time  I kept reading the book and hopes that something good will come but nothing  pure disappointment  Don t waste your time and money on this book  Oh and her writing style is unnecessarily graphic  repetitive  boring and ANNOYING ,1,Negatif,0
1473,This was a disappointment  The author gets too bogged down on the descriptions of little things that I got bored  I kept putting this book down because I was just not interested  I didn t like any character  there was nothing redeeming ,1,Negatif,0
1474,This was an interesting read  However  it was at times difficult to get into because the author got very wordy with rather irrelevant talk  A few times I was ready to give up on the book but it did provide me with a few naps  Ending not terribly surprising and left the reader without full closure,3,Positif,1
1475,I was so on the fence with this book  It presented as a thriller but it was severely lacking in that area  There was so much melodramatic suspense and description that i kept getting out of it  I was ready for the wrap up at the end  This would be a great movie but not a very fun to read book,3,Positif,1
1476,I have to agree with what many others have already said about the main character  How a woman who is supposedly a bright and intelligent woman could do so many stupid things is just simply unbelievable  It was difficult to get through this book  I think the editor let down the author on this one ,3,Positif,1
1477,Is it asking too much to create snappy dialog  a likable main character  and a believable plot  Apparently so  Seems like a lot of people liked this book  I thought it was just plain stupid and incredibly obvious  And the dialog   nobody talks like that  people  I enjoy a good beach read  but I prefer mine with no pretense of intelligence   just some down and dirty romance  a little smarminess  a fun beachy setting  perhaps a bit of casual sex  This book does not measure up   on any level  Waste of my time ,2,Negatif,0
1478,Meh  Practically every decision Erin  has  to make is a false choice  compounded by the fact that she can be counted on to choose the worst  least necessary option at every critical junction  More than once I found myself rooting against her ,3,Negatif,0
1479,This is a hard one for me to really give my opinion on because I can t decide if I liked it or not  The beginning had me hooked  but then things became so slow  It seemed to take forever for anything to happen  and when it finally did I was left underwhelmed  Around     things really started picking up and I didn t want to put it down but then it just fizzled out ,3,Negatif,0
1480,This book is somewhat like watching a      s movie serial  The dopey heroine sticks her head in a hornet s nest  the dopey heroine promises not to run into a burning building but does it anyway  Everything this woman does strains credulity at every level  How she managed to live as long as she had without some else murdering her is the biggest mystery in this stupid book ,2,Negatif,0
1481,I m honestly shocked to see all of these glowing reviews ,1,Negatif,0
1482,I was completely bored  The ending wasn t even close to be surprising ,3,Negatif,0
1483, I usually read hundreds of novels a year  and I really don t get the big deal about this novel at all ,1,Negatif,0
1484,honestly think that this is one of the two worst books I ve ever read ,1,Negatif,0
1485,just read Gone Girl  Worst ending ever and i rated it poorly and will not read any of your books,1,Negatif,0

1665,A lot of fluff in this book  Somewhat unclear  You can read so many other FREE books with the same information ,1,Negatif,0
1666,This is literally one of the worst books I ve ever read in my life  Great videos but it doesn t translate to writing  This book should ve been no more than    pages and what he uses to stretch it out is just mind numbing and incredibly boring irrelevant ,1,Negatif,0

1671,This book is a bunch of barely coherent nonsense copied and pasted together ,1,Negatif,0
1672,This meandering stream of consciousness has some great advice like clean your room and stand up straight  and the name dropping of lots of guys I read in college is an added bonus  Messiah complex much ,1,Negatif,0
1673,I was disappointed by this book  I almost entirely read nonfiction and yet I found this difficult to read  Peterson writes in a circular manner where he starts with one observation  then writes and writes  often referencing yin and yang   and doesn t quite make it back to explain his original point  Verbose  Redundant ,1,Negatif,0
1674,I really don t understand the popularity  I did not find it to give me helpful  rules for life  ,1,Negatif,0
1675,Please don t waste your money on this book  if you re not a devout Christian ,1,Negatif,0
1676,Vacuous nonsense with no real point  dressed up in obfuscatory flowery language to sound profound  The emperor has no ideas ,2,Negatif,0

1681,I couldn t stand to read this book after stumbling on this paragraph ,1,Negatif,0
1682,Also  he consistently equates women with chaos  providing a thinly veiled  and dimly reasoned  justification for gross misogyny  Save your time and money,1,Negatif,0
1683,I have endured three hours of his inane prattle and I still have derived nothing from it  Disruptive flows of thought  generic metaphor and personal allegory remind me of the slight of hand of the charlatan  I wasted a free audiobook on this drivel  Avoid ,1,Negatif,0
1684, The Bible seems to be the driving force behind it which explains some of the patriarchal perspective  I thought the information would be based on reason and logic  but it is not  If you are interested in evidence based psychology  do not buy this book ,1,Negatif,0
1685,Finished the book in a week and then downloaded and listened to the audio version on a long cross country drive with my    year old son   pausing at intervals to discuss and give personal examples amplification   Dr Peterson is possibly our last  best hope at stemming the tide of progressive totalitarianism ,5,Positif,1
1686,I would sign up for any class or lecture he offers  He s sincere and unapologetic with these rules ,4,Positif,1
1687,This book literally changed my life  I found out about Dr  Peterson after listening to a Jocko Willink podcast  which Peterson was a guest on  ,5,Positif,1
1688,I just finished reading it  actually  a few minutes ago   This book has an unmeasurable significance to me  It rekindled my interest in living  made me aware of my own faults and virtues ,5,Positif,1
1689,Overall  highly recommend  They should teach this book in schools  The more exposure to different ideas that are backed up by thought and empirical data  the better ,5,Positif,1
1690,I really connected with many of the RULES in the book and found myself reflecting internally throughout reading it  Highly suggest this book to put on your shelf to read now and refer back to often,5,Positif,1

1694,Extremely interesting,5,Positif,1
1695,It s the first book I ve ever finished and then immediately flipped back to page one and started again ,5,Positif,1
1696,Although I come from a very different perspective philosophically and politically than Peterson  there is always something  and hopefully a lot  to be learned from an erudite  smart guy  who is an avid student of life  human psychology and society  has accumulated tons of unique life experiences and writes well to boot ,4,Positif,1
1697,No matter what I write in this review it will not do this book justice  Without boring everyone with my life story  my life has had ups and downs like everyone else ,5,Positif,1
1698,It s what a lobster would ve done to move up the dominance hierarchy  roughly speaking  ,5,Positif,1
1699,This author is amazingly skillful at defending and expounding on his ideas clearly and eloquently  We are reading this book as a husband and wife together and it has already produced results,5,Positif,1
1700,That s it in a nutshell ,4,Positif,1
1701,I rather enjoyed reading this book  If you are reading it to find new information or insights into yourself  you will probably be disappointed  T,5,Positif,1
1702,This book is changing my life  It s not an easy read,5,Positif,1
1703,I just read some of the one star revues and had to laugh  Jordan Peterson is like pure oxygen  I ve been watching his YouTube videos for about a year now ,5,Positif,1
1704,If you re a man  or hope to be one some day  I can t recommend this book more  It isn t just for men  of course  It s for anyone who suspects  or hopes  that life is supposed to involve things which make all the suffering life will entail still worth it  It s about the desperate need in the world for strong  capable people  It s about becoming one of them ,5,Positif,1
1705, The best money you ll ever spend  I cannot recommend him more highly ,5,Positif,1
1706,This book is definitely in my top ten list of most impactful books I have read  Additionally  this book would make a superb gift for anyone graduating high school or college  Cannot recommend highly enough ,5,Positif,1
1707,Although I did enjoy the periodic discussion of Old and New Testament in a way that applied directly to life today ,5,Positif,1
1708, I guess you ll just have to read the book ,5,Positif,1
1709,In fact  as a lifelong political leftist  I m beginning to see my peers starting to act a little fascist themselves ,5,Positif,1
1710,Pepe did it again  ,5,Positif,1

1826,interesting,1,Negatif,0
1827,Short story  Pretty predictable  Even names were clique  Maisy the weak one  Marley the strong one ,2,Negatif,0
1828,Could NOT get into this book,1,Negatif,0
1829,Plot was contrived and unbelievable  Characters were not fully fleshed out   so predictable  Nuance lacking     why would a mom who had social standing abandon a child later in time  Plot did not hold together,3,Negatif,0
1830,It is a grat book,2,Negatif,0
1831,I have tried to buy this book no less than    times but every time I hit the Buy It Now button it sends me to my app store specifically to the Kindle reader makes no sense and I m extremely frustrated,1,Negatif,0
1832,Could have been better in terms of reality  Author tried to make too much of emotions and not enough character development ,2,Negatif,0
1833,It was an easy read  Reminded me of a Made for Lifetime Movie  Nothing remarkable ,3,Negatif,0
1834,Predictable and contrived   More appropriate as young adult book  So much better tale spinners around  Was tempted to give up on it a few times yet I did read to the very end  The first person comment of knees turning rubbery and nearly collapsing plus stomach knots and nausea over and over made the story seem juvenile and amateurish  Nothing here to ponder after the last page ,2,Negatif,0
1835,Easy beach read  It had a serious theme to it but certain parts were a bit too exaggerated for me ,3,Negatif,0
1836,Read this book while traveling  It easily helped pass the travel time ,3,Negatif,0

1840,A bit predictable  Didn t hold my interest well  I ended up skimming the second half just to get the major plot points ,3,Negatif,0
1841,A good read  Could get a little over dramatic and cheesy at times  but all in all a decent and entertaining read ,3,Negatif,0
1842,not my kind,2,Negatif,0
1843,This book was a simple read  I enjoyed it  and loved that the main character was flawed  but likeable  Three and half stars would be more appropriate  A great summer read  if you want something a little different ,3,Negatif,0
1844,The many many detailed intake of breaths  eyes fluttering  knees wobbling detract from the story  Use scared  nervous  shaky words instead  Everyone knows their meaning and can move on ,2,Negatif,0
1845,Nice summer read  Not totally predictable  characters I cared about and serious issues handled with compassion  Took on vacation and was able to put down and look forward to reading more later ,3,Negatif,0
1846,I wouldn t reccomend this book  It was slow and boring in many parts  The story was predictable from near the beginning ,3,Negatif,0
1847,An interesting story about families and abuse and how we deal with it  How it shaped the lives of everyone ,3,Negatif,0
1848,The book got under my skin  but nevertheless I finished it  Glad I did  Going all the way to the ending helped a good deal  I will probably be ok with her books ,3,Negatif,0
1849,Not the type of book I would normally read   This one was okay   Nothing that I can point out bad   Again just not my style  ,3,Negatif,0
1850,I enjoyed the story and the family  There was some truth to all of it  It shows you never know what people have experienced in their lives ,3,Negatif,0
1851,The story started off well  Then  it turned into drivel  The characters were well written  but the story was drippy weak  No substance ,1,Negatif,0
1852,Not great writing  just  fine   The story was actually pretty lame and predictable  Nothing special here  I would not recommend it ,1,Negatif,0
1853,Well written but not too complex  Characters well developed and interesting  Twists and turns made for quite a good read ,3,Negatif,0
1854,I found the beginning slow the latter part moved much quicker  Interesting story  told from two perspectives  mother and adult child,3,Negatif,0
1855,Sometimes the descriptions seemed over dramatic to me  The story at times a little unbelievable  But in general I enjoyed it enough to finish,3,Negatif,0
1856,I got     though and could not continue  Maisie is pathetic  So far the story is boring and very sad ,1,Negatif,0
1857,Waste of an interesting idea,1,Negatif,0

1865,I like historical novels  I will be visiting Austria and I plan on going to the Sacher restaurant for a Sacher torte  I loved reacquainting myself with the historical activities that were part of this book,5,Positif,1
1866,To make history live centuries after and still keep the reader interested and surprised is wonderful ,5,Positif,1
1867,The story and the events are complicated by necessity and history  Nevertheless  the author artfully develops the characters   The use of Love and Death as ephemeral characters throughout the book is unique and extremely well done  Bravo,5,Positif,1
1868,I liked this book  the history  romance and intrigue all interwoven  Using the analogy go DEATH and LOVE throughout the book was clever and oh so true ,5,Positif,1
1869,Loved the book  but thought that the injections of perspectives of Love and Death were unnecessary and strange ,5,Positif,1
1870, I enjoyed the multiple characters being intertwined in the time frame of early     s  Great history of Vienna s famous Sacher torte ,5,Positif,1

1913, I think this is my first self help book I did not like  There is tons of rambling about nothing,1,Negatif,0

3211,Although there were a couple times when I thought I had erred in choosing to read a  romance    not my usual genre   I came to the end of this book having really enjoyed reading it   Character development was slow and cumulative  and eventually I really cared about Christy Lynn  Wade  and especially Iris  Flashbacks were an effective way to show how Christy Lynn s fears were deeply related to the deprivations of her childhood  and why she could not allow herself to love   A wonderful book about the power of someone seeing past the facade we create to hide our fears  and loving us to free us from our past ,1,Negatif,0

4105,I  am a Grisham defender  but there is nothing defensible about this book  Yes  I was disappointed it didn t have the usual legal connection which  even at his worst  is always an education in the legal process  This book is just dull  I kept waiting for something to happen and realized     through that nothing was going to happen  Bad characters  Bad plot,2,Negatif,0
4106,I  bought this book in the Kindle version  It has many places where you simply cannot read the text  There are sections where you are instructed to answer a list of questions  These questions are in table form and the text is so small and close together than you just cannot read it  I would not recommend the Kindle version to anyone ,2,Negatif,0
4107,I  didn t like the subject matter  Women in Nazi hospitals being used for experimentation  I didn t finish the book ,2,Negatif,0
4108,I  give this book   star  here s why  their study is flawed     of the population is SECURE  on what planet are the authors living on  They even say on page      that the study is inconclusive on adults  That would make sense  cause as each age is reached  and if the need for that age is not met  insecurity increases ,2,Negatif,0
4109,I  got this delivered the other day for my just now   year old to be able to do  homework  while her older sister was doing her homework  I have gotten books like this before and have been happy  We have not worked in it yet but when i opened it i was disappointed in how small it was There are not many pages  ,2,Negatif,0
4110,I  have looked up several words that are not included in this dictionary  I know it s small  but not quite complete enough ,2,Negatif,0
4111,I  just didn t care  The author s liberal anti gun opinions were glaring ,2,Negatif,0
4112,I  liked this okay when I read it as a teen many years ago  Back then  my main problem with the book was that I couldn t identify with Ender  That  and the fact that the kids just didn t interact with one another the way real kids do  despite Mr  Card s assertion that  yes they do  just not where you can hear them    Re reading it as an adult  I found that my original impression didn t change much  I wanted to like Ender  but in the end  I just never was able to sympathize or empathize with him,2,Negatif,0
4113,I  love the concept of this book  However the one page stories don t allow for any depth at all and are written in a very elementary fashion   perhaps suitable for a     yr old but not much beyond that  The illustrations are beautiful ,2,Negatif,0
4114,I  never write reviews but beware if buying for ipad  This is probably not a fault of the author  I purchased the book but continually got a  download error  message on the kindle app  no troubleshooting suggestions from amazon seemed to alleviate the issue  I requested a refund through amazon ,2,Negatif,0
4115,I  purchased this book because every romance book blogger is raving about it  If you love cliched romance novels  with sex in every chapter  than this one is for you,2,Negatif,0

4117,I  think it s cute  but my    month old grandson didn t like it  He likes the book with the thick pages he can turn himself  Maybe he will like it when he gets older ,2,Negatif,0
4118,I  wanted to read the book as it has been made into a movie  which is to be released soon with Harrison Ford  I found the book somewhat enjoyable  But I felt that Book   of the series  didn t go as far as I expected for the Movie  I felt that I would need to read all the books in the series to be fully prepared for the movie  In general I try to stay away from books that are a series  If you like these types of stories  the series would be a good choice  I also felt as I was reading that it was geared for the younger readers,2,Negatif,0
4119,I  was disappointed  I always look forward to these books so I hope the next one gets back to the Colson family  I realize from the title of this one that it was planned to be more about  The Sinners  but I don t find those characters as interesting and prefer them to keep to the sidelines  I couldn t actually finish this one because I just didn t care,2,Negatif,0
4120,I  was hoping for more information rather than a few sentences about things to do,2,Negatif,0
4121,I  was very excited to hear about this book  and just read a few of the stories online  I love the idea  the powerful women stories but it is so very poorly written and so rough and scary for young kids to hear  I am reading reviews that parents read these stories to their     year old girls  Mine are   and   and I can t read word by word these stories to them   Malala storty     the men fired their guns  hitting her in the head  Malala was rushed to hospital  and she did not die   On what level is this a bed time story    ,2,Negatif,0
4122,I  wish I would have known this was in this book  my daughter who is   read this story and instantly said  mom this book isn t right   Sad that my   year old knows right from wrong and apparently these  authors  do not  There should be a WARNING all over this book ,2,Negatif,0
4123,I  would only recommend this book to someone securely attached who is dating an anxiously attached person and seeking guidance or to someone single feeling frustrated in the dating pool who is only looking for guidance on selecting the best mate,2,Negatif,0
4124,I  borrowed  this book from my daughter  who is in high school  As a middle aged literature buff  I liked the book because the author mentions all the hard to understand  depressing works I had read decades ago  that I had never had the opportunity to discuss with anyone  and I that I hadn t any intention of re reading  ,2,Negatif,0
4125,I absolutely hated it   ,2,Negatif,0
4126,I absolutely loved the podcast  I m on my third run through it now  Somehow  the translation to this medium just didn t work for me  I m happy to support the work though and hope future iterations will be a little better  I feel like too much of the story changed and all that was kept were a couple of one liners  However  I did see an animated short someone made and posted to Facebook that was absolutely hilarious  If that ever comes out as an official product I ll be all over it  Unless you are just a really big fan that wants to support the brothers  you could stay away from this one and not miss much ,5,Positif,1

4132,I agree with the other reviewer  I could not finish this book  I wanted to like it but it never grabbed me Honestly this is so boring i can t stand to read it to the finish  The only reason i bother to write this review is to spare others the agony of this sophmoric writing ,2,Negatif,0

4137,I always try to select a new author each week  This week was Barbara Davis   I was pleasantly surprised  what a great book  it took hold from page one and never let go until the last page   This book had everything you could ever want in a book   I always was a sucker for an happy ending  but I also love that you had a lot of heartbreak to get through until you found your happy ending  and this is what this book did   Looking forward to reading more books by Barbara Davis ,2,Negatif,0

4141,I am a sometime amateur turner  but due to my work situation   Recommended ,2,Negatif,0
4142,I am a very big fan of the Dresden Files  This book made me really unhappy  Working for Bigfoot has been out for a long time so recycling all of those stories into a new release book made me feel ripped off  I expected original stuff and got very dissappointed  The newer stuff is good though,5,Positif,1
4143,I am about half way in and doubt I will finish this book  It s not  hilarious   after the initial scenes with extremely self involved and consumer driven wealthy people  the social satire wears thin and the characters become barely distinguishable from each other  The petty rivalries and family conflicts pass for a plot  but really who cares  if this were a tv soap opera  it would probably be cancelled before the end of the season ,2,Negatif,0

4184,I am writing a Positif review  I agree with most of the other Positif reviews and I want to add a few things If you are generally a nice person with great values and some self control  you are probably already employing most of the concepts in this book  I m a nice guy and after every chapter I kept saying  I do that   Even though I feel like I already have been using most of these concepts  there were a few that this book helped to reinforce ,2,Positif,1
4185,I avoided this book for my life because an early mentor warned me against it being  phony   However I believe the book is at a minimum  a great set of cheap parlour tricks  But it goes beyond that  Dale Carnegie provided a roadmap for how people should behave politely and effectively in capitalistic society ,2,Negatif,0

4278,I did the    days and was religious  I continued to eat healthy afterwards and had smoothies for breakfast quite often  Most are delicious and it isn t easy for food lovers but I lost    lbs in total   This includes the time after that I kept to eating well and heading to the gym a couple times a week  I probably lost    from just the cleanse  I would say the best part is kicking the sugar and caffeine  I have much more energy without drinking the morning coffee when I drink a smoothie in the morning ,1,Negatif,0

4336,I enjoy this book  ,5,Positif,1
4337,I enjoyed catching up with the lives of familiar characters from  Crazy Rich Asians   however the sequel was more character driven than plot driven  The climax was too severe and not in keeping with a social parody  I am still looking forward to Kwan s final book in this trilogy ,5,Positif,1
4338,I enjoyed Crazy Rich Asians but this sequel was a bit silly  It was entertaining enough to hold my interest but it was just okay  in my opinion ,5,Positif,1
4339,I enjoyed Grisham s earlier books  when he posed some ethical questions  OK  only occasionally and not very deep ones  in the context of a good page turner ,5,Positif,1
4340,I enjoyed reading this book because it s so simple and fun to read  As an Amazon First  I took my time picking it because I wasn t Positif about reading it,5,Positif,1

4346,I enjoyed the book   I had never read Bohjalian  liked his writing ,5,Positif,1
4347,I enjoyed the light  fun reading that was Crazy Rich Asians  and China Rich Girlfriend was similar in that regard  If you are on vacation and want a no brainier to read  both of these books are a good poolside breeze through  especially if you have spent any time in Asia and can relate to the setting of the novel   I did enjoy the first novel more than this one  however  Here the author is so repetitive in his descriptions  I kept wondering if he has heard of a style other than  Art Deco   Read the first novel  but take or leave this one ,5,Positif,1
4348,I enjoyed these books as a kid and particularly enjoy reading this one to my    mo son  ,5,Positif,1

4350,I enjoyed this book and feel that I learned a lot about myself and past relationships  However  I was quite conflicted because I relate strongly to secure AND anxious attachment  I m fact  on the quiz  I was tied on those   types  yet there is no mention in the book of this possibility,5,Positif,1
4351,I enjoyed this book immensely   Michael Singer gives profound insight about the duality of life  perception versus consciousness and seeing life as part of the whole universe and natural order   Each chapter expands on ideas that are thought provoking and is brief and concisely written  To be such a short book  only     pages  Mr  Singer gives you a tremendous amount of information   I read the book once and then again underlining passages I thought were significant   I may read it yet again   The last chapter  number     is mystifying   Instead of tying everything together  this chapter goes off into ideas of mysticism and a  divine force  which I thought was counter to the first    chapters   But  if you skip the last chapter  the the other chapters give you much to ponder ,5,Positif,1
4352,I enjoyed this story  it had wonderful  flawed yet changing characters in it  The only reason I didn t give it   stars was for the F bombs in it  T,5,Positif,1

4355,I expected to love this book  I certainly like the subject matter and was looking for a fun refresher after years away from school  But try as I might  the book just bored me  Foster is no where near as funny as he think he is or wants to be  He seems a genial enough writer  and I think he truly wants readers to understand literature  but the writing of this book is just so boring  I am sorry to say I can t recommend it  My suggestion would be to keep looking ,5,Negatif,0

4375, This isn t a light easy subject   if it s read quickly and without much thought  the point will be missed in whole or in part   The end few chapters on death and transcendence didn t particular resonate with me but probably would be meaningful to others   Overall I am very happy I read the book and most definitely feel I received significant benefit ,5,Positif,1

4476,I have studied this same philosophy in a few venues   Somehow Singer has brought it to life for me like none other   The  inner life  of the mind  the self dialogue that we mostly keep to ourselves is described quite accurately   How is this possible if it is not a universal human experience   How can Mr  Singer know it so well   He must have done some serious inquiry into a topic of great relevance and little exposure in current culture ,1,Negatif,0

4636,I must admit I only made it half way through the book  It s pretty nauseating  It s nothing but Goff bragging about how rich he is and how perfect his life and family is  Within the first half of the book Goff never mentions any personal setbacks or how he ever  became love  to a difficult person  I bought this book based off a short devotional I read on the Bible app so I thought the book was going to be Bible based but in the first half of the book there isn t one single Bible verse listed at all  It is however full of Goff s personal thoughts and ideas  I lost count on the number of times he used the phrase  I think     ,4,Positif,1
4637,I must admit to being somewhat disappointed   ,4,Positif,1
4638,I must have backtracked on audible a hundred times  I thought I knew most of the info  having followed Rachael Maddow   but I have a lot more clarity now regarding how exactly Trump became so infatuated by and willing to roll over for Putin   It s almost like Putin played hard to get   If you often feel like you missed the central plot when you watch the news  this book will help bring you to where we sit today  minus who was fired or indicted this week  I d skip the audible version though  It s too robotic ,5,Positif,1

4647,I normally like Anne Tyler s work  but this one  not so much  I tried and tried to finish this book  but by the halfway point I came to the conclusion that the characters were just flat to me  I couldn t determine any feelings or personality in them  The book was like watching tv with the sound turned off  I finally gave up  But I really did try to like it ,5,Positif,1

4655,I paid a lot for the hard bound and was absorbed in the story and most annoyed at the ending which was so abrupt  it left many loose ends and teasers of a sort  I do not want to spoil the book for others as it was a good read ,4,Positif,1
4656,I picked this book up based on a recommendation from my husband who recently listened to it on a cross country trip  I am a child of the  late     s and have an immense appreciation for the pop culture of that decade  It was a fun  light read to relax with ,5,Positif,1

4663,I put my new shop together   Nice,5,Positif,1
4664,I quite enjoyed this book  it was fast paced and kept me engaged  the reason I gave it three stars was because of the age of the characters  children ages six  ten  twelve don t run armies and worlds  not even geniuses  as long as I ignored the ages of the characters it was a good read  also even though the characters were children they were given the maturity of mature adults  which doesn t fit  just because someone is a genius doesn t make them mature  lastly the children were constantly lied to and manipulated and used as pawns in the adult world  don t get me wrong  it was a great story just that the characters were way too young to be plausible,5,Positif,1
4665,I rarely buy cookbooks  but I love everything Michael Greger does  so I bought this one  I ve made about ten of the recipes so far  and it is phenomena,5,Positif,1
4666,I rarely write reviews  but this book has been so life changing for me ,5,Positif,1
4667,I rated the book a   out of   because the book is very helpful if you want to learn how to read literature in depth  My only problem was that  while it uses multiple great and well known examples  it also had a number of references I didn t get  The book does a great job of explaining but it can also go  overboard  in detail  This led me to be confused at times but I still fully understood the book  I d suggest this to anyone who wanted to be a writer  understand literary techniques or perhaps just wanted to learn more about literature in depth ,5,Positif,1
4668,I read a lot of travel books and plan pretty much all of our family trips on my own  with only a few exceptions  ,3,Positif,1

4677,I read this book after I saw the preview for the movie  It started off pretty good but just got boring  There was no plot twist  nothing surprising happened  It just ended  No surprise ,5,Positif,1
4678,I read this book back in the summer of      for AP LIT and did not like the book at all  I recently reread it to see if my opinion has changed and it actually got worse  The problem with this book is that the author tells you that there might be symbolism or something hidden in the plot  but not what they mean or how to find it out  It didn t give me answers and was definitely not lively and entertaining as I found it to be dull ,5,Positif,1
4679,I read this book because it was on one reviewers  top    books he s ever read  list  and sounded interesting  I was a little skeptical because I m no longer a Science Fiction Fantasy fan  loved it in my younger days   and that was the eventual  downer  in this book for me  I did enjoy parts of it  and I did finish it  but the last third of it was very difficult going  If you can believe a   year old boy in a distant future can have the judgment  leadership  and logic attributed to Ender  fine for you  I didn t ,5,Positif,1

4700,I really enjoyed the first     pages or so as the story moved from Willa as a child  later attending college  and then as a wife and mother  T,,Positif,1
4701,I really enjoyed these short stories  Though it s nice to see Harry taking care of these    brief cases    it was even better reading about secondary characters and how they see the world and Harry in some cases  More stories from Marcone  Molly  Butters  Maggie  and especially Mouse  the true brains of team Dresden   I hope Jim Butcher considers other characters for the future  including Hendricks  Marcones bodyguard   Mister  Toots  and maybe an adventure with Maggie and the younger Carpenter kids ,4,Positif,1
4702,I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it if you enjoy some of the geekier nerdier aspects of pop culture or gaming in general  but it does have some glaring flaws  ,5,Positif,1

4708,I really liked this book  But I don t think the title really fits the book well ,4,Positif,1
4709,I really liked this book  Kept me riveted  So many twists and turns and surprises  His writing is always an adventure and the characters so likable ,4,Positif,1
4710,Instead the book ends up losing the main characters in the shuffle and merely becoming a laundry list of designer brand names and a sad version of life styles of the rich  famous in their own minds and incredibly boring ,2,Negatif,0

4717,I really wanted to like this  It sounded so funny and perhaps a bit of culture thrown in as well  There was just far too much going on for me to be able to get invested in the storyline though ,4,Positif,1
4718,I really wanted to love this book but I found myself just skipping to the end so I could learn how it ended but it was too annoying to read  It reminded me of Twilight set in Africa  substitute magic for vampires  with all its teen angst  It was also incredibly repetitive ,4,Positif,1

4750,I spend much time with Chinese of all degrees of wealth or not  This novel has the usual references to expensive status purses  dresses etc  In this it is like any other chick lit  I do not particularly enjoy that genre  but there is a bigger problem  All the characters sound like Americans or British  ,5,Positif,1

4755,I started using this for my   yr old  I think its a great beginner book  We follow the easy steps and we dont jump around  we follow it   it seems to help my child  It starts off very basic  tracing  shapes  letters etc then gets more challenging  This is the first work book that I have found that seemed to be at her level  She not quite       yet and this book seems to be exactly where we needed to begin  She enjoys it   looking forward to her finishing it up ,3,Positif,1

4775,If you start reading  stick with it for the end  which is the best part ,4,Positif,1
4776,I thought Crazy Rich Asians was great   interesting characters in absurd situations  and insight into the culture of Singapore  This sequel felt like nothing more than an effort to capitalize on that success  which of course it is  but in the good sequels the author has something new to say  At times it was little more than a tedious list of high end brands and products  If you start reading  stick with it for the end  which is the best part ,5,Positif,1

5222,It is written in a format that is easy to read  and regardless if you have ever heard of Rachel Hollis or not  you ll want to join her tribe by the end of the book ,4,Positif,1
5223,It isn t all that exciting a read but I had to know how it ended ,4,Positif,1

5231,It presents a very definite bias,4,Positif,1

5233,It reads very busy if that makes sense  A lot is presented  I was looking for a more simple book explaining who is who  It does not lack for thorough information though  It was just not what I was looking for ,4,Positif,1
5234,It really holds my daughters interest   Pictures are simple and clear   The story is cute and easy enough for a toddler to understand ,4,Positif,1
5235,It really is a great book i do recommend and will be buying the horse and fairies books for my kiddo ,4,Positif,1
5236,It seemed to be a summary of books I had already read  ,4,Positif,1
5237,It seemingly looks like a money making scam ,4,Positif,1
5238,it seems to be a good ,4,Positif,1
5239,It too forever for this book to get going  but it turned out to be a pretty gripping paranoid journey through a newly totalitarian state ,4,Positif,1
5240,It took the author    years to find that psychology and psychiatry do not work ,4,Positif,1
5241,it was a birthday gift,4,Positif,1
5242,It was a fun read ,4,Positif,1
5243,It was a good summer read ,4,Positif,1
